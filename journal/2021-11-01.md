Working on [[libft]]
- strlcat is giving me some trouble, not sure how to handle negative numbers. size_t is an unsigned int, so it converts the -1 to 0.
  - handled :) only have one mko error (malloc size, doesn't matter)
- strnstr has a bunch of errors shown by the new testing unit
- substr has a bus error
  - solved,
